# Static Website Boilerplate

## Why?

Because it sucks to bootstrap static websites.

 * it sucks to write HTML
 * it sucks to write CSS
 * it sucks to handle JavaScripts

## How

I use guard with Sprockets to handle assets compilation.
I use Bourbon with Neat (which is awesome btw.), but feel free to hack it over.
I use Slim.
I write CoffeeScript.
I deploy files using Mina and the AWS S3 hosting service.
